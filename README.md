### 🔄 Architecture Overview

The system follows a **3-Tier Architecture**:

### 🖥️ Client Tier (React SPA)
- React Single Page Application
- Deployed on Vercel
- Communicates with backend using HTTPS (REST APIs)
- Uses Axios for JSON request/response handling

### ⚙️ Application Tier (Spring Boot)
- REST Controllers (API Endpoints)
- Service Layer (Business Logic)
- Repository Layer (Data Access)
- DTOs for Data Transfer
- Hibernate (ORM Layer)
- Deployed on Render

### 🗄️ Data Tier
- Relational Database (TiDB Cloud)
- MySQL-Compatible Distributed SQL Database
- Executes SQL queries from backend

> This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
